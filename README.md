### Fishing

I will quickly tell you how all this work and how to prevent it 

```Fishing is a type of attack if you will, there is many ways to do it but some of the more populor ones is.

-Facebook
-Google account
-Instagram

Fishing is done by fx. Sending a fake email with a link inside it, when the "victim" in this case its you, click on the link they get redirektet to a browser where they have to log in (fx. Google account) When the victim then logs in the "attacker" witch is me then gets the email you types in and your password. We would also call this credentials.


If you are here that means you just fell for a fishing attack now, I will not be using the credentials I got this is only and I mean ONLY for eductational puposes. This is to show how easy it can be sometimes to be tricked in diffrent ways by people you might know or not know at all.
