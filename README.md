Clicking on links you don't know/recognize is never a good idea, especially if it comes from someone you don't know.

### Phishing

I will quickly tell you how all this work and how to prevent it 

```Phishing is a type of attack if you will, there are many ways to do it but some of the more popular ones are.

-Facebook
-Google account
-Instagram

Fishing is done by FX. Sending a fake email with a link inside it, when the "victim" in this case its you, click on the link they get redirected to a browser where they have to log in (FX. Google account) When the victim then logs in, the "attacker" which is me then gets the email you type in and your password. We would also call this credentials.


If you are here that means you just fell for a fishing attack now, I will not be using the credentials I got this is only, and I mean ONLY for educational purposes. This is to show how easy it can be sometimes to be tricked in different ways by people you might know or not know at all.
